//! A set of generic storage abstractions for the page server to use when backing up and restoring its state from the external storage.
//! This particular module serves as a public API border between pageserver and the internal storage machinery.
//! No other modules from this tree are supposed to be used directly by the external code.
//!
//! There are a few components the storage machinery consists of:
//! * [`RemoteStorage`] trait a CRUD-like generic abstraction to use for adapting external storages with a few implementations:
//!     * [`local_fs`] allows to use local file system as an external storage
//!     * [`rust_s3`] uses AWS S3 bucket as an external storage
//!
//! * synchronization logic at [`storage_sync`] module that keeps pageserver state (both runtime one and the workdir files) and storage state in sync.
//! Synchronization internals are split into submodules
//!     * [`storage_sync::compression`] for a custom remote storage format used to store timeline files in archives
//!     * [`storage_sync::index`] to keep track of remote tenant files, the metadata and their mappings to local files
//!     * [`storage_sync::upload`] and [`storage_sync::download`] to manage archive creation and upload; download and extraction, respectively
//!
//! * public API via to interact with the external world:
//!     * [`start_local_timeline_sync`] to launch a background async loop to handle the synchronization
//!     * [`schedule_timeline_checkpoint_upload`] and [`schedule_timeline_download`] to enqueue a new upload and download tasks,
//!       to be processed by the async loop
//!
//! Here's a schematic overview of all interactions backup and the rest of the pageserver perform:

//!
//! First, during startup, the pageserver inits the storage sync thread with the async loop, or leaves the loop uninitialised, if configured so.
//! The loop inits the storage connection and checks the remote files stored.
//! This is done once at startup only, relying on the fact that pageserver uses the storage alone (ergo, nobody else uploads the files to the storage but this server).
//! Based on the remote storage data, the sync logic immediately schedules sync tasks for local timelines and reports about remote only timelines to pageserver, so it can
//! query their downloads later if they are accessed.
//!
//! Some time later, during pageserver checkpoints, in-memory data is flushed onto disk along with its metadata.
//! If the storage sync loop was successfully started before, pageserver schedules the new checkpoint file uploads after every checkpoint.
//! The checkpoint uploads are disabled, if no remote storage configuration is provided (no sync loop is started this way either).
//! See [`crate::layered_repository`] for the upload calls and the adjacent logic.
//!
//! Synchronization logic is able to communicate back with updated timeline sync states, [`TimelineSyncState`],
//! submitted via [`crate::tenant_mgr::set_timeline_states`] function. Tenant manager applies corresponding timeline updates in pageserver's in-memory state.
//! Such submissions happen in two cases:
//! * once after the sync loop startup, to signal pageserver which timelines will be synchronized in the near future
//! * after every loop step, in case a timeline needs to be reloaded or evicted from pageserver's memory
//!
//! When the pageserver terminates, the upload loop finishes a current sync task (if any) and exits.
//!
//! The storage logic considers `image` as a set of local files, fully representing a certain timeline at given moment (identified with `disk_consistent_lsn`).
//! Timeline can change its state, by adding more files on disk and advancing its `disk_consistent_lsn`: this happens after pageserver checkpointing and is followed
//! by the storage upload, if enabled.
//! Yet timeline cannot alter already existing files, and normally cannot remote those too: only a GC process is capable of removing unused files.
//! This way, remote storage synchronization relies on the fact that every checkpoint is incremental and local files are "immutable":
//! * when a certain checkpoint gets uploaded, the sync loop remembers the fact, preventing further reuploads of the same state
//! * no files are deleted from either local or remote storage, only the missing ones locally/remotely get downloaded/uploaded, local metadata file will be overwritten
//! when the newer image is downloaded
//!
//! To optimize S3 storage (and access), the sync loop compresses the checkpoint files before placing them to S3, and uncompresses them back, keeping track of timeline files and metadata.
//! Also, the remote file list is queried once only, at startup, to avoid possible extra costs and latency issues.
//!
//! NOTES:
//! * pageserver assumes it has exclusive write access to the remote storage. If supported, the way multiple pageservers can be separated in the same storage
//! (i.e. using different directories in the local filesystem external storage), but totally up to the storage implementation and not covered with the trait API.
//!
//! * the sync tasks may not processed immediately after the submission: if they error and get re-enqueued, their execution might be backed off to ensure error cap is not exceeded too fast.
//! The sync queue processing also happens in batches, so the sync tasks can wait in the queue for some time.
